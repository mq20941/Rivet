Description:
  'Abstract:

Differential and double-differential cross sections for the production of top quark pairs in proton-proton collisions at 13 TeV are measured as a function of jet multiplicity and of kinematic variables of the top quarks and the top quark-antiquark system. This analysis is based on data collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $2.3\,\text{fb}^{-1}$. The measurements are performed in the lepton+jets decay channels with a single muon or electron in the final state. The differential cross sections are presented at particle level, within a phase space close to the experimental acceptance.

  Rivet:
  
This analysis is to be run on $\text{t}\bar{\text{t}}$ Monte Carlo. The particle-level phase space is defined using the following definitions:
\begin{description}
\item[lepton]: an electron or muon with $p_\text{T}>30\,\text{GeV}$ and $|\eta|<2.5$, dressed within a cone of radius 0.1,
\item[jet]: a jet is reconstructed with the anti-$k_t$ algorithm with a radius of 0.4, after removing the neutrinos and dressed leptons, with $p_\text{T]>25\,\text{GeV}$ and $|\eta|<2.5$,
\item[b-jet]: a jet that contains a B-hadron.  
\end{description}

A W boson is reconstructed from a lepton and the sum of the neutrino energies, while another W boson is reconstructed from a light jet pair. The two top quarks are reconstructed by combining b jets to these W boson. A check based on the W boson and top quark masses is performed to choose the proper combinations.
